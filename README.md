## Problems We Are Trying to Solve
### Order Management Complexity for Amazon Sellers

Amazon sellers often face challenges in tracking and managing the status of orders efficiently due to high order volumes and frequent status updates.
Sellers lack a consolidated view of real-time order statuses, leading to inefficiencies in processing, shipping, and customer service.

### Limited Visibility into Order Status Updates

Amazonâ€™s native interface may not provide customizable or detailed reporting on order statuses that sellers need for quick decision-making.
Sellers often struggle to identify delayed or problematic orders in a timely manner, potentially impacting customer satisfaction.

### Manual Monitoring and Data Entry Overload

Sellers may need to manually monitor order statuses and update internal systems or spreadsheets, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.
Manual processes can delay response times for shipping or resolving issues, such as handling cancellations or returns.

### Inefficient Communication with Fulfillment Teams

Poor visibility into order statuses can create communication gaps between sellers and fulfillment teams (e.g., warehouses, shipping providers).
These gaps can result in delays, miscommunication, and increased operational costs.

### Lack of Insights for Optimization

Sellers often lack analytical tools to derive insights from order status data, such as identifying trends in delays or high-cancellation items.
This hinders strategic decisions related to inventory management, logistics, and customer experience improvement.
